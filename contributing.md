# contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Svelte Snake Sports!
I'm still figuring this out and feedback is appreciated.

## issues

[The issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ryanatkn/svelte-snake-sports/issues)

## PRs

[Pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/ryanatkn/svelte-snake-sports/issues)

Smaller changes and obvious improvements don't need an issue.

[the discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/ryanatkn/svelte-snake-sports/discussions).
Anything relevant is welcome here.

## highscores

This project tracks highscores as links to videos in [the main readme](readme.md).
To submit a score, please open a pull request with a link to the video
and the player's GitHub user name (if available),
inserted into the list for the particular sport, ordered by best score.

> to add a score with less effort,
> you can also open issues if you'd prefer, or just contact me privately

When this no longer scales on the readme,
we'll create a JSON file and render the scoreboard to a webpage, probably.

> currently the highscores are uncontested!
> dare you try unseat my scores?
