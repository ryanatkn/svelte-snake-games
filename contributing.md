# contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Svelte Snake Sports!

This project is free and open source software with a public domain license.
The goal is to support students and creators and players in a fun game context.
It's just a little hobby project so set your expectations accordingly :)

## custom games

Svelte Snake Sports is designed to be reusable to create custom variations.
As a developer, you can fork the code and either edit a game directly or copy-paste a new one.
There's also
[this Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/ebf7455697c3497ab358675de43bb1e0?version=3.52.0)
that lets you make new variations right in your browser.
If you make a variation you like, please share and we'll link to it!

## highscores

This project tracks highscores as links to videos in [the main readme](readme.md).
To submit a score, please
[open a pull request](https://github.com/ryanatkn/svelte-snake-sports/pulls)
with a link to the video
and the player's GitHub user name (if available),
inserted into the list for the particular sport, ordered by best score.

> to add a score with less effort,
> you can also
> [open issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/svelte-snake-sports/issues)
> if you'd prefer, or just contact me privately

When this no longer scales on the readme,
we'll create a JSON file and render the scoreboard to a webpage, probably.

> currently the highscores are uncontested!
> dare ye contest 🐢
