## what

In 2016 I wrote a tiny [`snake-game`](https://ryanatkn.github.io/snake-game)
for an interview in React. Today I use Svelte instead, but I continue to enjoy games of
[Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_game) 🐍
So, this project started as a port of that small React codebase to my current Svelte patterns.
I have a feeling there's some fun stuff on the way!

This project plans to make many distinct versions of Snake in Svelte that are
interesting in terms of gameplay, game design, and/or technical implementation with Svelte.
If we're lucky, it'll be simple enough for beginners to follow along
and deep enough to hold the interest of more advanced students like myself.

> note: [the project from 2016](https://ryanatkn.github.io/snake-game)
> uses Create React App and has no lockfile,
> and given that I wish not wake eldritch npm horrors,
> I am not going to try to run the code, and I advise you not to try,
> so much so that I won't even directly link the repo
> (though it's trivially inferred; also it's archived)
