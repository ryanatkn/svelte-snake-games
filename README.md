## what

Years ago I wrote a little [`snake-game`](https://ryanatkn.github.io/snake-game)
for an interview in React. These days I use Svelte instead, but I continue to enjoy games of snake 🐍
This project plans to make many distinct versions of snake in Svelte that are
interesting in terms of gameplay, game design, and/or technical implementation with Svelte.
If we're lucky, it'll be simple enough for beginners to follow along
and deep enough to hold the interest of more advanced students like myself.
