Here's [the source code](https://github.com/ryanatkn/svelte-snake-sports/tree/main/src/lib/sports)
for each sport.

caveats:

- it's responsive to smaller screens but doesn't have good mobile controls yet
- some of the code is still very rough from the port, I just tried to ship gameplay asap
- some of the code has experimental patterns that I wouldn't recommend

plans:

- publish a library

## what

In 2016 I wrote a tiny [`snake-game`](https://ryanatkn.github.io/snake-game)
for an interview in React. Today I use Svelte instead and I continue to enjoy
[Snake](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_game)
for thinking through frontend development patterns.
This project started as
<a href="https://ryanatkn.github.io/svelte-snake-sports/classsic">a port</a>
of the React version to my current Svelte patterns (with some experiments and hacks)
and it's growing from there.

This project plans to make many distinct versions of Snake that are
interesting in terms of gameplay, game design, and/or technical implementation with Svelte.
If we're lucky, it'll be simple enough for beginners to follow along
and deep enough to hold the interest of more advanced students like myself.

> note: [the project from 2016](https://ryanatkn.github.io/snake-game)
> uses Create React App and has no lockfile,
> and given that I wish not wake eldritch npm horrors,
> I am not going to try to run the code, and I advise you not to try,
> so much so that I won't even directly link the repo
> (though it's trivially inferred; also it's archived/readonly)
